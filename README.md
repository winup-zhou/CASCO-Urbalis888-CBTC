# Urbalis 888 CBTC
BVE5/6 implementation of the CASCO Urbalis 888 CBTC signalling system.
This project is based on zbx1425/TGMT-CBTC project.

Supports the simulation of ATO and ATP, both CBTC(moving block) and BM(fixed block) signalling modes, while focusing on various details.  

**We are currently in the early stages of preparation and have not yet started coding.**
